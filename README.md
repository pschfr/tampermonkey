# Tampermonkey
These are my custom Tampermonkey scripts.

### What is Tampermonkey?
Tampermonkey is a [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/), [Safari](https://safari.tampermonkey.net/tampermonkey.safariextz), and [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/) extension that allows us to add additional JavaScript code to any webpage, adjusting the performance or functionality to our desire.

Each folder has a readme explaining what I fixed or adjusted.

Also be sure to check out [stylish](https://github.com/pschfr/stylish), my custom CSS for other websites!
